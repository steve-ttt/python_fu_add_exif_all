Gimp Plugin to Modify exif data to all open images (exiv2 must be installed)


This is a learning expericnce for me to work out how to write gimp plugins. My end goal is to write a suite of plugins to make my life easier for my film photography scanning work flow. This seemed like a good place to start as it should be reasonably straightforward. 


DEPENDIANCIES : this plugin requires exiv2 to be installed 


on fedora use:

$ sudo dnf install exiv2


on ubuntu use:

$ sudo apt-get install exiv2



This is for my own ammusment and I don't use mac or windoze so I dont know if if works or not.
